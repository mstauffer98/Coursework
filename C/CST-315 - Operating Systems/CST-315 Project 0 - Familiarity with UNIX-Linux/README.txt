This project was an introductory exercise on the commands of Linux
for my Operating Systems class. This was done using the Linux terminal
through a VirtualBox encapsulation of an Ubuntu system. A number of
extraneous files used with the project were included in the original
submission. Also, we needed to create a C program for the submission
since we looked coded in C as the primary language for the rest of the
class. The Word document bests encapsulates the project.
