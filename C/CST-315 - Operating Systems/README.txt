CST-315 was designed to examine operating systems and they work
internally. We used Ubuntu's version of Linux, through a VirtualBox,
and coded in C for our assignments. The IDE used to code in C was
Code::Blocks. The "Assignment" and "Project" projects built off of 
the other similarly-named assignments in respect or another.
