The goal of the assignment was to illustrate the famous producer-consumer
problem of process synchronization. The program uses Linux's POSIX
semaphores as switches which regulate the creation and destruction of
items on a shared buffer. We were permitted to use a online source's
code for the program, but I explain its procedure in the Word document.
