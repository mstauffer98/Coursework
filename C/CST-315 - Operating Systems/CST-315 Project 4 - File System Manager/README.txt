The following lines must be inserted into the system's Linux terminal in order for the code to properly run and for all utilized Linux commands to function (Dey, 2017).:
     sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev
     sudo apt-get install tree

For Code::Blocks, the following line must be inserted into the Project->Build Options...->Linker settings->Other linker options: (stdcall, 2013).:
     -pthread -lreadline

The goal of the project was to simulate a number of file
management procedures through our previously-made Linux
terminal. We were given permission to use preset Linux
commands and then just explain what they did. Documentation
regarding the project is allocated within the Word Document.
