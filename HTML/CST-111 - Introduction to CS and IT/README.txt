CST-111 was the introductory class to programming and 
computer science of my university's CS and IT programs.
The course primarily worked with the Python-Java hybrid 
Jython as its programming language. We worked with the
IDE JES (Jython Environment for Students) to program our
code. The ".py" files in the folder above will only
likely work within this IDE because of its use of Python
with a lot of use of Java syntax and keywords. One 
project, however, did involve building a web page with
an HTML script and hence it is included above.
