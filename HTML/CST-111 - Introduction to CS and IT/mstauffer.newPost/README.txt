The goal of this project was to create a HTML script and implement a
webpage through Jython. There were certain facets that the page had to
have, but we were given permission to make the webpage on whatever 
topic we wanted. While I do not remember the entire list of HTML facets,
we did have to create a link to a picture (the smiley face) and include
a download link of the the project itself. To see the website, open the
".htm" file. The HTML and Jython scripts are included in the ".txt" file
and ".py" files, respectively.
