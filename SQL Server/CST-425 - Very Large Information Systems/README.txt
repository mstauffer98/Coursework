The goal of CST-425 was to look at a number of big data analysis methods,
including machine learning, sentiment analysis, and dimensionality
reduction. The course was a program emphasis course, specific to the
emphasis of Big Data Analytics. The work for the course was primarily
written in R, but some Python and a little SQL was involved. The project
above was the one that used SQL Server. The SQL query was written on the
platform Microsoft SQL Management Studio and the code in R was developed
in the RStudio development application.
