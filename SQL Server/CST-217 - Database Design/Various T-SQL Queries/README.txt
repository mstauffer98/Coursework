This folder contains a variety of different example query scripts we wrote
throughout the course. These involved scripts especially from discussion
questions, activities, and projects during the course. A folder of the
databases used in the course have also been included. There were principally
three examples databases that we used for different purposes. These would be
necessary for working with the query scripts in their original intention.
