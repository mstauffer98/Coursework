These are database backup files used in the course for work with the query
scripts. They should be in an easily importable format for MS SQL Server
Management Studio, being in the designated ".bak" format. However, the
query scripts may be able to recreate most of these databases, anyway.
These databases were backed-up as I found them, so they have likely been
affected by my query scripts in the course. Regardless, these should give
a glimpse of what we worked with in the course. There was one database
known as "Adventure Works" which was also used in the course. However,
the backup file was too large to import to GitHub, so it is not present.
To be had, the "Adventure Works" database likely is available online as I
would understand that it is a notable, widely-used database example set.
