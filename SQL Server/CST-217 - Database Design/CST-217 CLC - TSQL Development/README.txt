This is a project in CST-217, which revolved around the ideas of database
construction and management. The project involved creating a social media
network database. The work was a team effort between me and a classmate,
Tristen Soto. The "SQLQuery" script involves the accomplishment of certain
tasks we had to accomplish for the assignment, affecting our social network.
The tasks are noted by which partner wrote the code for which task.
Screenshots of the tasks in the script are shown in the Word document. A
backup of the social media database is also included in the "social_media.bak"
file. A lot of the scripts involved with producing this social media network
database are included in the folder "CST-217 Social Media Database Code." More
information can be understood about the project from those scripts as well.
