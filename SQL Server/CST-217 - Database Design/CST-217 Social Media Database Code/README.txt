This is a collection SQL query scripts involved with the production of an
example social media network. These scripts were used alongside the
database of the project outlined in the CST-217 - CLC TSQL Development
folder. The first script ("CST-217 CLC Social Media Database") sets up the
tables of the social media database. The second script ("CST-217 CLC -
TSQL Development") performs different necessitated tasks for the project
involved. The third script ("CST-217 Insert Data Statements...") was used
to allocate and insert the data of example users inserted into the social
media database, which we used for the project involved. The fourth script
was a query script of tasks we performed for the presentation of our
project and social media database. Presumably, the presentation had to
present certain components of the database, and these were illustrated by
running this script. The fifth and final query script inserted 1000
points of data into the social media database. This data was randomly
produced from an online generator and was used for a demonstration of
working with a large bulk of data in a database as the social media
database involved.
