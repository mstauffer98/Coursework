The goal of CST-217 was to introduce database design, management, and querying.
Its lectures as well as many projects involved the creation of databases and
extraction of data. The class had its work primarily written in SQL Server
(T-SQL) code on the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio platform. There a
hand of databases manipulated throughout, both self-created and given to us.
The folders above have formal projects created for the class as well as a folder
of various, extra SQL Server queries, which also demonstrate my experience with
the language.
