This project was designed to examine the hash table data structure.
We were to input a large corpus of text and have each word indexed
into the table. We would then have a functionality to search through
the table to identify whether the word was indexed as well as how
many times it was indexed. Therefore, on runtime, the user could
type in a word, and the program would output how many times it
appeared in the text. Now, with regard to the specific text, I am no
advocate of socialism or socialistic ideals, but I am fan of irony.
Therefore, I ended up with choosing the Communist Manifesto for my
corpus. The loom video link shows my demonstration of the code and a
few examples of words to be found in Marx's text.
