This project was designed to examine the idea of weighted graphs. Thinking
about nodes of a network, the edges between each node may be best described
with a weighted value rather than just say a connection of "1." A set of
eight nodes was defined in the "Input.txt" file, where there was described
the weighted edge connections between each node. The program took in that
file and processed the information as a data structure. The program then
outputted the connections between each node and the weight of the path
between any two nodes if there was one.

Here is a Loom video link to my description of the project for my original
submission. The description above may be easier to understand, but this
does highlight some things from the assignment.:
