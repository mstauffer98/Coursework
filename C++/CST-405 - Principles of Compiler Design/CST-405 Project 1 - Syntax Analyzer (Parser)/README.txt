This project was the second in a series of projects in building a programming language
compiler. This project encapsulated the syntax analyzer, also known as the parser, of the
compiler. The program sought to expand upon the lexer previously built, taking in the
tokens table produced from the lexer. The tokens table would be used to check the syntax
of the tokens from the source code against the grammar allocated in
"CST_405_modified_grammar.docx." A parse tree of the grammar of the source code would also
be made and fully produced with a fully syntactically correct code. The "Parser" class is
called to analyze and go through each token of the source code's tokens table. The
"ParseTree" header file is used to build the parse tree of the code. There may be a few
bugs in this code, but it was tested to be mostly operational. More details about the
project can be found in the documentation in the Word document.
