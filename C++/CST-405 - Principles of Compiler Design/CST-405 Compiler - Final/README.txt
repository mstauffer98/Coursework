This project was the final project for the compilers course. This project was designed to
contain the fully working compiler that could take in code and output executable assembly
code. This project consists of work from all five major projects of the course. Each
project dealt with a specific component of a compiler, being a lexer, parser, semantic
analyzer, code generator, and optimizer. The final two steps were more or so less
consolidated in the course within this project. To note, this course was very difficult
and time-consuming. Therefore, some things that were initially designed to be incorporated
did not unfortunately make it to the final executable portion in the code generator. This
compiler for the fictional "C--" language can still reliably run basic code, producing the
expected output.

The project here includes the original code, test files, documentation across the five
projects of the course, a brief specifications analysis of the compiler, a grammar sheet
for the intended functional grammar of the "C--" language, and a text file mentioning how
to run the code. The code was initially run using the online compiler "Repl.it." It was
attempted to get the code to work with an IDE as Visual Studio, but it appears the compiler
was having trouble in one way or another. "Repl.it" uses the "clang" command to compile the
code
