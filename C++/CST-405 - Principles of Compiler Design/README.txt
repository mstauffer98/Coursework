The goal of CST-405 was to teach students how compilers and with that the basis of
programming languages work. The whole course revolved around an ongoing project, being
a compiler of the fictional, C-variant language "C--." The project was encapsulated in
the five major parts of a compiler, being the lexer, parser, semantic analyzer, code
generator, and optimizer. The optimizer was reduced and consolidated for the sake
of time for the course. However, a functioning compiler that utilized aspects from all
of these stages was built in this course. The folders above contain the compounding
projects, where "CST-405 Compiler - Final" is of the complete compiler. This was
likely objectively the hardest core computer science course of my major due to the
sheer volume of work. There are still some bugs in the compiler, but the density and
hard practice of work in object-oriented programming are there. The project was overall
written in C++. The first projects - especially the lexer and parser - were built using
Visual Studio. Eventually, the project turned into a group project and by the time for
building the code generator, the project was built using the online code editor
"Repl.it."
