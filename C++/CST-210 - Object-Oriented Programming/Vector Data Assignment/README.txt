This project looked to introduce the concept of dynamic arrays. The project 
involved building a vector data structure class which could expand or shrink an
array of values as desired. There were a number of different functions that 
needed to be applied as well like the "vector" library structure in C++. There
was some confusion however with this project in the class as we were all still
new to programming. The project was supposed to be done more as a dynamic array
in that the array would be made to expand or shrink. In the midst of the 
confusion though, many of us ended up thinking that the idea was that we needed
to use the actual "vector" library. Our professor went over the confusion in class
and allowed us to resubmit the project with an array rather than a pure "vector"
implementation. The resubmission is in the project folder "Improved Vector Data
Assignment." Also to note, there is a slight error with the "<<" operator
function in this project, which was fixed in the improved version.

The below is an adapted except from the README of the original submission of this
project, describing the input to the program.:


The program should be pretty easy to understand. After being compiled, the program
will need six values to process the program. The values can be integers, letters,
characters, etc. since it processes broad, string values. The rest of the code is
automatic and can be analyzed as necessary.
