This project was a revision of the project in the folder "Vector Data
Assignment." The project looked to introduce the concept of dynamic arrays. The
project involved building a vector data structure class which could expand or
shrink an array of values as desired. There were a number of different functions
that needed to be applied as well like the "vector" library structure in C++.
Out of some confusion in class, the original project mistakenly used the actual
"vector" library. This uses an alternate, manual implementation with arrays, 
expanding or shrinking a structure of data values. This project also fixed some
of the issues I was having with the implementation of the "<<" operator in the
original project submission.

The below is an adapted except from the README of the original submission of this
project, describing the input to the program.:


The program should be pretty easy to understand. After being compiled, the program
will need six values to process the program. The values can be integers, letters,
characters, etc. since it processes broad, string values. The rest of the code is
automatic and can be analyzed as necessary.
