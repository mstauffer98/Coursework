The goal of CST-210 was to teach students the concepts of object-oriented programming
(e.g., polymorphism, inheritance). It was a very project-based, coding-heavy course,
teaching the basics of object-oriented programming through the C++ language. The folders
above contain the course's C++ coding projects as well as in-class activities. A lot of
the projects of the course were assigned to be in game form, hence many of their names.
The in-class activities and participation code are not as robust as the projects, but
they do demonstrate the topics that we looked at in the course.
