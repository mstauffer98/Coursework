This project was designed to introduce the idea of classes in object-oriented programming.
The project was given as an open-ended card game for students. The game could be any card
game with a normal playing card deck. I chose the simple card game of War for this assignment,
where the higher valued card gets both cards. My variant of the game ended when all cards
had been drawn and the player with the most cards won. Unfortunately, being new to C++ at
this time, I struggled considerably with the project, and so the program is not wholly
functional. Since then, I believe I was having trouble with variables assigned between
header files. This project still does show the considerable amount of effort and strides
I made with understanding C++.
