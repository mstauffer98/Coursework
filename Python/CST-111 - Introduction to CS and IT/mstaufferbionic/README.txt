The goal of this assignment was to recreate the other coding projects
from the class in fewer lines of code. The three projects Collage,
PickAndShow, and PurpleFilter were chosen. The files with "Bionic" in
their name can be compared to their corresponding original code 
submissions. The extraneous picture files within this folder were
originally with the class's projects, and hence are included here
as well.
