A bit of a story with this one: Grand Canyon University's mascot is
the Antelopes (or 'Lopes, for short). So, my professor wanted us to
create a collaged picture of other pictures, showing that the mystical
jackalope was a real creature. The code creates a collage of a picture
of myself with two versions of the jackalope: a jackrabbit with antlers
and an antelope with jackrabbit ears. The goal of the project was
hence to demonstrate picture editing through the use of code.
