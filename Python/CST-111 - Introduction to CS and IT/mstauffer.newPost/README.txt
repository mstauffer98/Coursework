The goal of this project was to create a webpage through Jython handling
an HTML script. There were certain facets that the page had to have, but
we were given permission to make the webpage on whatever topic we wanted.
While I do not remember the entire list of HTML facets, we did have to
create a link to a picture (the smiley face) and include a download link
of the the project itself. To see the website, open the ".htm" file. The
Jython and HTML scripts are included in the ".py" files and ".txt" file,
respectively.
