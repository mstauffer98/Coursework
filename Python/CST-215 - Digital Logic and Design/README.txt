CST-215 is the discrete mathematics course at Grand Canyon University.
It went over various logical schemes, automata, proofs, and more as a
part of the class. The folders and files above pertain to the various
programming projects involved with the class, which were written in
Python. The IDE PyCharm was the original platform the code was written
on. Some of the files I don't remember what they were used for, but
were likely used in the class at least as in-class exercises.
