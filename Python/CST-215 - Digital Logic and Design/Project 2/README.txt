This project involved a numbers game where the goal was to get to 100 by adding by
small increments 1-10. The game would involve two players, where there was an exploit
to block out the other player from winning. We were supposed to implement the game
with the ability to handle 0, 1, or 2 real players. I noticed after submitting that
the formula mentioned in the code is slightly incorrect in some facet. The alternate
"READ_ME" was originally submitted with the project and has a link to my explanation
of the code in video form as was required by my professor. The code was originally
written in the PyCharm IDE.
