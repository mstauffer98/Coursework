This code analyzes a logical expression with regard to a number of aspects, especially
a truth table. Our work was supposed to fix a pre-existing code made by a previous
professor. The code has a better, deeper explanation than I remember since it has been
over a year and a half since I took this class. The alternate "READ_ME" was originally
submitted with the project and has a link to my explanation of the code in video form
as was required by my professor. The code was originally written in the PyCharm IDE.
