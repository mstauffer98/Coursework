The goal of CST-425 was to look at a number of big data analysis methods,
including machine learning, sentiment analysis, and dimensionality
reduction. The course was a program emphasis course, specific to the
emphasis of Big Data Analytics. The work for the course was primarily
written in R, but some Python and a little SQL was involved. These are
the projects that were written in Python. The original code submissions
were all originally created on the PyCharm IDE.
