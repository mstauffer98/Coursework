The goal of the project was to examine the idea of dimensionality reduction.
As explained in the paper, each column of a dataset can be considered a 
dimension of the total data picture. Processing data can be very costly, so
if certain dimensions can be removed to save cost, while still retaining the
overall accuracy of the data, it is a worthy endeavor to delete these columns.
So, this project examines four different techniques as how to determine which
columns may be valuable to remove. The program for the project was originally
written as a Jupyter notebook on the IDE PyCharm. The project is further
detailed within the Word document.
