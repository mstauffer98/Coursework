The goal of the project was to build and examine the principles of a
search engine. The search engine structure implemented in the project
was Python Whoosh. We had to incorporate a corpora of documents for the
search engine, so I used collection of scripts from Disney films, given
by the professor. The program runs as a search engine, giving the most
relevant documents per search query. A couple filters are applied to the
corpora, taking account for stop words and stems of words. More details
and example queries are explored in the relevant project Word document.
