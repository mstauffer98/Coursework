The goal of the project was to continue from Project 3, looking at search
engines, and incorporate web scraping alongside a search engine. As in
Project 3, the search engine structure used was Python Whoosh. The corpora
for the engine were scraped from the web using the Beautiful Soup library.
The corpora involved a collection of webpages of quotes of famous people
from the site BrainyQuote. The program runs as a search engine, giving the
most relevant quote authors per term searched. More details and example
queries are explored in the relevant project Word document.
