CST-305 is my program's course on differential equations. Each topic of the
course went over a number of mathematical models and concepts, each with a
corresponding project. The projects all involved some level of coding, some
just graphing an ordinary differential equation and others something more
abstract. The code was written in Python, frequently utilizing the ODEINT
library. The code was originally developed in the IDE PyCharm. I do need to
give a lot of credit to my project partner Ryan Jones as he often took over
many of the coding project. He went overboard with a number of the projects,
especially towards the end of the course, finishing the project before I was
able to help him. I still contributed as much as I could or, at least, as
much as Ryan would let me.
