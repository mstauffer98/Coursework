The goal of the project was to examine the idea of association rules.
This topic goes logically with the subject of shopping transactions,
determining associations between items bought. The dataset used was 
therefore a series of shopping transactions from a French grocery
store. Analysis of common transactions and visualizations of the
association rules were done in the project. More details about the
project and its code can be found in the RMarkdown document or its
knitted HTML file.
