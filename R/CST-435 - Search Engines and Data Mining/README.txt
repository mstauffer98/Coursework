The goal of CST-435 was to look at the specific topics of search engines
and data mining as well as examine a number of big data analysis methods.
The course was a program emphasis course, specific to the Computer Science
emphasis of Big Data Analytics. The work for the course was primarily
written in R, but some Python was involved as well. These R projects above
were developed in the RStudio development application.
