The goal of this project in CST-435 was to practice and test the
retrieval of information from a social media site. Specifically,
the project used data from Twitter using the plaform's developer
API. The project sought to use the API to collect data from and
then examine characteristics about tweets regarding two keywords.
At the time of the project, I chose to examine and compare the
tweets with the terms "Ginsburg" and "Scalia." This was done at
the time shortly after Justice Ginsburg's death, so as to compare
the discussion of people comparing the Ginsburg situation with
the time when Justice Scalia passed away. Ultimately, a number of
things were compared with these subject tweets, including common
words and location of users tweeting. More can be understood by
looking at the RMarkdown or its knitted file. Screenshots from
the original collection of the tweets are included in this folder.
Running the project again will incur different results. Also, to
note, the API credentials are my own and may be desired to be
changed if tested. There is a limit on the API usage, whatever the
case.
