The goal of the project was to highlight the idea of term
frequency in a corpus as a part of the topic of data mining.
The corpora used for data mining were the novels of Robert
Louis Stevenson. The novel texts were taken from the site
Project Gutenberg, using the gutenbergr R library. The most
common words from Stevenson's novels were examined in the
project and were displayed as word clouds for visual effect.
Further analysis of the terms and more details regarding the
project can be found in the RMarkdown document.
