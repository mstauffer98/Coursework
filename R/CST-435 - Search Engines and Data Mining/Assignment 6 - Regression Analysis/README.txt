The goal of the project was to look at and demonstrate regression analysis. The
project focused on a dataset regarding baseball statistics. Four metrics (ERA,
runs, batting average, and OBP) were applied to a regression model to see if
there was a correlation between a statistic and the number of wins of a team. The
regression analysis of all of the metric statistics against the number of wins
per MLB team were examined and illustrated visually. Conclusions were drawn about
the most correlative metrics. The code and more details about the project can be
found in the RMarkdown document or its knitted HTML-formatted file.
