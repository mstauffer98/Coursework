The goal of the project was to demonstrate the K-Means clustering algorithm.
The dataset chosen was one regarding buildings in New York City,
specifically the borough of Manhattan was examined. The land area of each
building in the dataset as well as the number of floors were specifically
examined in the project. The buildings were put into clusters by the 
land area or number of floors against the year each building was built.
More details about the project can be found in its RMarkdown document or its
knitted HTML form. The dataset for the project is in the .csv. Three PDF
files are also included, which give background information about the dataset,
as taken from the Kaggle repository.
