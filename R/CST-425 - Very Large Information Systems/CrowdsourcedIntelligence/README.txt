The goal of the project was to perform a truth analysis regarding
a certain topic, that is, to find the truth of the topic with regard
to an aggregate of relevant texts. I describe the methodology in
detail in the R Markdown document, but I'll summarize it here too.
The topic of global warming was examined. Twenty different online
articles were collected in text and HTML forms. On the basis of four
different metrics, the twenty articles were given a score. Each score
was then plugged into a greater truth analysis equation to calculate a
final truth score. The greater the score the greater likelihood of the
truth is held by the source. All of the sources held the same view that
climate change is occurring, so only the weight of reliability of the
truth among the set of texts was found.
