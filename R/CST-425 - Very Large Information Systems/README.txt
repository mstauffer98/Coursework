The goal of CST-425 was to look at a number of big data analysis methods,
including machine learning, sentiment analysis, and dimensionality
reduction. The course was a program emphasis course, specific to the
emphasis of Big Data Analytics. The work for the course was primarily
written in R, but some Python and a little SQL was involved. These R
projects above were developed in the RStudio development application.
