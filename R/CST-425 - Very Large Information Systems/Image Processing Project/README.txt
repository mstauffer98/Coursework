The goal of the assignment was to look at different classification
algorithms. The first part was a simple classification exercise
with regard to the Iris dataset. The second part was a matter of
examining a set of images and trying to classify the identities of
a subset. The images chosen were of a collection of pictures of
Czech coins. A training set of the pictures was put into the program
and the remaining were tested for their currency identities. The
identities of the coin pictures were classified using four different
algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Backpropagation
(i.e., Neural Networks), and Ada Boosting.
