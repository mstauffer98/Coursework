The goal of the assignment in CST-425 was to examine a collection
of texts and determine the emotion of the writer with regard to a
particular topic. I decided to collect 100 film reviews regarding
the 2018 film The Commuter. The reviews (in the .csv file) were 
marked as positive, negative, or neutral regarding the film. The
R program is trained with the texts and sentiments of 80% of the
reviews. The remaining 20% become a test set, where a sentiment
analysis of each review is performed. This determines if the emotion
of each review could be appropriately classified to the sentiment
manually marked. The glmnet, Na√Øve Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
algorithms are each used for the classification process.
