The goal of the project was to display different methods of
visualization with regard to the data of a set. In other words,
the goal was to illustrate different aspects of the data that
were not immediately evident from just looking at it raw. We
were given a lot of freedom with the project, but I made an
animated scatterplot and a collection of pie charts, each
displaying different points of the data.
