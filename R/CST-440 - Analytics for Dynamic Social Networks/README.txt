The goal of CST-440 was to look at the topic of social network analysis,
focusing around the relationships of node connections. Each project had
to do with a different focus of social network analysis, such as
friendship, business, or criminal networks. The course was a program
emphasis course, specific to the Computer Science emphasis of Big Data
Analytics. We were permitted to work as partners for the projects for
the sake of time and combined effort. I ended working with a partner for
Projects 1, 3, 7, and 8, the others being solo efforts. The work for the
course was permitted to be written in R or Python, but R was more chiefly
used, and hence I used R for all of the projects. These R projects above
were developed in the RStudio development application.
