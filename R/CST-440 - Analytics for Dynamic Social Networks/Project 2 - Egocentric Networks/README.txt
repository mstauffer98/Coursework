The goal of this project in CST-440 was to examine the topics of
egocentric networks and survey generators. Egocentric networks are
networks based around a center node. Therefore, this project more
specifically focused on building a network where each student was
the center node. This network was built by sending out a survey,
gathering information from the questions as name, positional, and
resource generators. These generators were designed to tell certain
things about those in one's immediate social network. More details
can be found in the RMarkdown or its knitted HTML file.
