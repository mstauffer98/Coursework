The goal of this project was to examine the topic of strategic
alliances for business networks. The dataset for the project was
a set of board members of companies in Norway. The project and
the idea of strategic alliances focused then on the idea of
overlapping corporate boards. A sample of companies which had
overlapping boards was taken, and centrality metrics were
calculated to identify the relationships between companies and
board members. Two theoretical scenarios for strategic alliances
were then analyzed and applied to the same centrality metrics.
More information about the project can be found in the RMarkdown
or its knitted HTML file.
