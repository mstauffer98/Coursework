This goal of this project in CST-440 was to examine the topic of
health networks. We took a dataset from online of information
regarding mental health information of individuals surveyed in
Bangladesh. We visualized the data from a few different
perspectives, using a contrived network of the individuals. We
then analyzed the networks from the perspectives with visual
graphs. Then, we used regression to examine the correlation
between certain attributes and whether someone had a mental
health problem. I worked with a classmate, Uriel Serna Haro,
for this project. He found the dataset and did the network
graphs. I chiefly took care of the regression part. We both
then split up the writing for the documentation of the project,
focusing on our individual sections. More information about the
project can be found in the RMarkdown file or its knitted HTML
file.
