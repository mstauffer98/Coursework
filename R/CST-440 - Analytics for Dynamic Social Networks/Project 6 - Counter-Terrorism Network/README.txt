The goal of this project in CST-440 was to examine the topic of
criminal networks, specifically terror networks. A dataset was
used which identified relationships between individuals involved
in the Tuareg Rebellion in Mali. Centrality measures were applied
to identify key figures and therefore ones who would be useful
to "take out" in the case of a counter-terror operation. A
theoretical counter-terror network was also proposed and analyzed
in accordance to best fighting a terror network. More information
about the project can be found in the RMarkdown or its knitted
HTML file.
