The goal of this project in CST-440 was to examine the topics of
friendship networks and social network analysis regression. The
dataset for the project was randomly generated amongst a list of
numbers, representing individuals. The dataset was a binary dataset,
where "1" represented a friendship connection and "0" a lack of
friendship. The goal of the project was to visualize the dataset
as well as analyze the regression of a friendship "quality"
predicting the original friendship connections. The friendship
"qualities" analyzed were mutual friendships, unreciprocated
friendships, and classmate relationships. The likelihood of each
correlating to the original friendship matrix was analyzed in this
project. More information about the project can be found in the
RMarkdown or its knitted HTML file.
