The goal of this project in CST-440 was to examine the topic of
bipartite networks. Bipartite networks are networks of nodes of
two separate types of node. This type of network was frequently
examined throughout the course, so this project worked well as
an introductory project. The dataset for the project was taken
from online, representing connections between CEOs and private
clubs of which they were members. I was looking for a partner for
this project, and I ended up working with a classmate, Joe Samyn.
It happened that he had completed most of the code for the project
by the time we partnered up. However, I was able to help by
writing some of the introductory sections for the project,
including a detailed synopsis of the "Comparison of Methods"
journal article we were given. More information about the project
can be found in the RMarkdown or its knitted HTML file.
