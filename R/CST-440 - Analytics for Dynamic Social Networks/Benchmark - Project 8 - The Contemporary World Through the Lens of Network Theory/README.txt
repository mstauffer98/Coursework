The goal of the project in CST-440 was to examine the topic of
international networks. The project focused on the relationships
between countries from the perspectives of trade, military,
transportation, and corporate relationships. Ten countries were
chosen, and connections between the countries from the different
perspectives were found and applied. I took care of the trade
and corporate perspectives, and my partner for the project, Uriel
Serna Haro, took care of the military and transportation
perspectives. Each of these perspective networks was visualized
and analyzed, and conclusions were drawn and written up. A
consolidated network of the networks was also developed with
visualization, analysis, and conclusions drawn about the
countries overall as well. More information about the
project can be found in the RMarkdown or its knitted HTML file.
