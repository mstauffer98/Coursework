The goal of this project in CST-440 was to examine the different
mathematical metrics involved in social network analysis. A
dataset from online was used, which regarded Wikipedia
administration voting among different users. The dataset was very
large, so only a small sample was used for calculating the metrics.
The project included metrics such as density of a network,
centrality of various nodes, and stress within a matrix. I
completed the project with a classmate, Andrew Goodman. I took care
of most of the first part of the project, including the initial
data handling, density, and centrality measures. I also added some
to his work for the conclusion. More information about the project
can be found in the RMarkdown file. As a note, even with the
reduced dataset sample size, running the RMarkdown file may still
incur technical difficulties. R may shut down in these cases, so
retrying to run the code is best.
