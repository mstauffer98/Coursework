The goal of this project was to finish the study of fractals from Project 6 by introducing
a stochastically-produced fractal forest. The fractal forest would create fractal trees on
top of each node of the original fractal from Project 6. The fractal production from
Project 6 was corrected in this project, hence a difference in look from Project 6, despite
the same general ruleset. Three different types of trees were supposed to be produced, each
having a ruleset with which would be used to stochastically draw out a tree formation. The
look of the trees will be generally different from runtime-to-runtime. There was some
confusion as to what exactly our professor wanted with regard to fractal forests. However,
this was our best understanding, though it could be different from a standard stochastic
fractal forest. More details about the project can be found in the documentation of the
Word document.

The project was originally run on a virtual machine of Ubuntu 18.04. The following was
taken from the original project submission's README file, detailing how to compile and
run the code.

Libraries Used: GL, GLUT, GLU.

Step 1- Download the zip folder and extract the folder

Step 2- Open the command console and navigate to the extracted folder

Step 3- "g++ Project7.cpp -o project7 -lGL -lglut -lGLU" in command line to compile the program

Step 4- "./project7" in the command console to run the compiled program.
        NOTE: If the fractal forest renders off screen, then the window may need to be resized or the program rerun.

Controls: E - Exit
