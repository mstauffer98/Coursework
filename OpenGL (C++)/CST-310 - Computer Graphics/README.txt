The goal of CST-310 was designed to introduce the basics of computer
graphics and practice the formulation of graphics in code through OpenGL.
There were a handful of different coding projects designed to look at
different concepts of computer graphics, with Projects 4 and 5, 6 and 7,
and 9 and 10 being continuations of each other. The code was written in C++
but used the OpenGL graphics library, hence making the code more uniquely
OpenGL than simply just C++. The first project was developed using Visual
Studio on a Windows 10 OS, incorporating the necessary libraries through the
NuGet Package Manager. The OpenGL libraries, however, we used in class were
more Linux-oriented, so Projects 4-10 were implemented in Visual Studio Code
on an Ubuntu 18.04 virtual machine. Using a Linux OS would likely be the
best method for running the programs. The README files in the different
projects detail the specific OpenGL libraries needed to be installed and
used to compile to run the programs.
