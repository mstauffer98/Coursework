The goal of this project was to demonstrate the production of an animation with OpenGL.
This project was very open-ended in that we could pick whatever we wanted to do for the
animation. The two major stipulations for the animation though, to my memory, were that
it had to be at least 30 seconds long and the animation had to be some of substantial, 
intriguing, or educational value. More details about the project can be found in the
documentation of the Word document.

The project was originally run on a virtual machine of Ubuntu 18.04. The following was
taken from the original project submission's README file, including a link to a
demonstration video of the project animation as well as details of how to compile and
run the code.:

Libraries Used: GL, GLUT, GLU.

Step 1- Download the zip folder and extract the folder

Step 2- Open the command console and navigate to the extracted 
    folder

Step 3- "g++ Project8.cpp -o Project8Output -lglut -lGL -lGLU" in 
    command line to compile the program

Step 4- "./Project8Output" in the command console to run the compiled program
