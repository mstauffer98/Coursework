# Coursework
This is a collection of the coding coursework throughout my academic career. It is organized by the different
languages and tools I have used, and then by the courses in which the work was done. This portfolio will be
gradually expanded and updated as I organize and push more of my collegiate coursework.


My university has a policy against publicly sharing coursework online hence these files were encrypted into
archived .zip folders. The folders will need to be downloaded, and then a password entered to look into each
file. If you would like the password, please contact me at stauffermd@gmail.com. Thank you.
